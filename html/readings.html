	Through photography, I’ve always seen it as art and also a form of remembrance, as a way to capture that one beautiful moment or just to remember a special moment. With digital cameras now being widely available and even in the grasp of our pockets, we’re able to take photos very quickly in great detail. Whether it be the aspects of daily life, such as hanging out with friends, eating food, or even walking during a peaceful night. You will get this rush of urge to take a picture of everything, just cause you’re able to. In a way, I believe it’s like time keeping, being able to look back on those small moments is emotionally pleasing. Similar to some points made in “Plato’s Cave”, photos of family create a sense of belonging or even “memento mori”, where every photo is like a fragment of time of a person’s life, recording what is the past. 
	In the aspect of art, photography is the way I’ve viewed how great something was. <br />
From videos, I learned that symmetry and lighting mattered a lot. I feel in a way photography warps our view of the world because the photos created aren’t what we actually see, it’s enhanced, so in a way it changes our reality. When hanging out during special moments, whenever I raise my phone, I try to look for special angles that can capture something special, something that I can resonate with. If I were to represent our world visually using photography, I would choose the raw images. We live in a space where everything is enhanced, rather then that, I would express some realness through photography, in order to approach this, I would capture the aspect of daily life we look past. People are communicating, looking at their phones in public areas, or even people shopping in grocery aisles. <br />
	Although this might feel ordinary to most, I feel these actions are looked past on, as people might not view these times as valuable because they do repeat these small actions every time during their routine. I would say these moments are what are most special, as it reflects a person’s world and their life. Although capturing just a normal picture of someone walking doesn’t really convey any context or emotion. Perhaps combining high resolution close up photographs of an individual’s face or eyes could provide understanding of a certain individual, or even their inner state of emotion. <br /> 
	Ideally, my approach to photography will convey both a sense of realism and reality by capturing normalness. Photography allows us to view our world, but we can use that power to preserve common life. Although it might be true that photography also has the power to change our view of reality, it can also allow us to reconnect with what is overlooked. In order to do it, we have to look closer, within ourselves are the most ordinary moments, and allow ourselves to slow down and capture those ordinary moments that fill our lives.
